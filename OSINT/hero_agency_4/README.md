### Write up

Thanks to the photo of the itinerary that the observer posted on Twitter, we can see that the agent was taken away:

- **Next to a dungeon**
- **On the second floor of a tower**
- **Less than 30 minutes drive from Vannes**

A simple Google search allows us to find a conclusive result:

The place will not be enough since the message speaks about a tower, it is thus necessary to find which room. To find that, we need to find out more.

By going on the website of the fortress, [https://www.largoet.com/](https://www.largoet.com/), there is a page "Discover" then "Description" on the top navigation bar. Then, at the bottom of this page, we find some presentation leaflets:

Looking at the brochure, a room on the second floor is mentioned:

We have found where the agent is being held, it is the **garde-robe**! We must now notify the agency as soon as possible so that its special forces can respond as soon as possible. It is our last flag, congrats :)
