Hi Bob!

Welcome to our firm. I'm Dave, the tech lead here. We are going to be working together on our app.

Unfortunately, I will be on leave when you arrive. So take the first few days to get familiar with our infrastructure, and tools.

We are using YouTrack as our main issue tracker. The app runs on this machine (port 8080). We are both going to use the "dev" account at first, but I will create a separate account for you later. There is also an admin account, but that's for our boss. The credentials are: "dev:aff6d5527753386eaf09".

The development server with the codebase is offline for a few days due to a hardware failure on our hosting provider's side, but don't worry about that for now.

We also have a backup server, that is supposed to backup the main app's code (but it doesn't at the time) and also the YouTrack configuration and data.

Only I have an account to access it, but you won't need it. If you really have to see if everything is running fine, I made a little utility that run's on a web server.

The command to check the logs is:
curl backup

The first backups might be messed up a bit, a lot bigger than the rest, they occured while I was setting up YouTrack with it's administration account.

Hope you find everything to you liking, and welcome again!

Dave
