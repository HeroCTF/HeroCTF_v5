# IMF#2: A woman's weapon

### Category

System

### Description

Historically considered as a woman's weapon, pretty sure that's not true and anyone can exploit it.

**PS*: *When you understand what to exploit, try it locally first, as a failed attempt would very likely make any further attempts impossible.*
