description: "This is a very simple puzzle. The pieces are in the `puzzle.pickle` file in the following format:<br><br>
```python
pieces = [(up, right, down, left, payload), (up, right, down, left, payload), ...]
```
<br><br>
`up`, `right`, `down`, `left` are the IDs of the piece edges. You should put together corresponding edges. There are no unused pieces.
<br><br>
They are all integers.
<br><br>
The `payload` field is a python string, composed of a single character contained in the following charset `'0123456789abcdef'`.
<br><br>
The flag is the concatenation of the payloads of the pieces composing the diagonal from the upper-left corner to the lower-right corner.
