description: "It's the same type of puzzle as before, but we are adding one dimension. The pieces are in the `puzzle.pickle` file in the following format:
<br><br>
```
pieces = [(up, right, front, down, left, back, payload), (up, right, front, down, left, back, payload), ...]
```
<br><br>
The flag is the concatenation of the payloads of the pieces composing the diagonal from the upper-left-front corner to the lower-right-back corner.
