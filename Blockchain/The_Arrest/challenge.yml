From his small apartment in a forgotten corner of Moscow, Swissy had wreaked havoc on the digital world, crippling entire industries with his ransomware attacks. <br>
But tonight, his reign of terror ended abruptly. A sudden knock echoed through the room, followed by the splintering of the door as Russian FSB agents stormed in. <br>
Swissy was arrested, but the real challenge was only beginning - tracing the syndicate behind him.<br>
Find the address who funded the ransomware operator (0xf6c0513FA09189Bf08e1329E44A86dC85a37c176)<br><br>
